# WhatsappWeb4j Request Analyzer

This program was developed on top of [WhatsappWeb4j](https://github.com/Auties00/WhatsappWeb4j) and is fully written in Kotlin.

The goal of this program is to analyze both raw json and encrypted binary requests sent by WhatsappWeb's Web client to WhatsappWeb's 
secure WebSocket and vice-versa. This is very useful if you want to contribute to WhatsappWeb4j by adding new features.
